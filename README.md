### ft_printf

This project is to recreate the stdlib function printf

Project completed at [42School Fremont](https://www.42.us.org/)

##### Notes

* There is a make file in the root directory
 * Typing `make re` will compile the code, and create libftprintf.a
* Testing the code
 * In the srcs directory there is an empty main file where you can write a test (`ft_printf("My name is %s\n", Zack);`)
 * while in the root directory you can compile the library with the test using the comp.sh script (`sh comp.sh`)
