### ft_printf

This project is to recreate the stdlib function printf

Project completed at (42School Fremont)[https://www.42.us.org/]

##### Notes

* There is a make file in the root directory
 * Typing _make re_ will compile the code, and create libftprintf.a
* Testing the code
 * In the srcs directory there is an empty main file where you can write a test (_ft_printf("My name is %s\n", Zack);_)
 * while in the root directory you can compile the library with the test using the comp.sh script (_sh comp.sh_)
