## Ft_printf

Recreation of the ubiquitous printf function

I completed this project as a part of the curriculum at [42School Fremont](https://www.42.us.org/)

##### Notes

* This project is dependent on my library: [libft](https://github.com/ZackSmith32/42_libft)
 * Typing `make re` will compile the library: libftprintf.a
* To test the code
 * Clone dependency libft (mentioned above) 'make' that code
 * Create a test main function.  Compile the test main function and include the header and library files for both libft and printf.
 * Compile statement should look something like this:
 	* gcc test_main -I libft.h ftprintf.h -L. libft.a libftprintf.a
